            <h3>Overland Park Native</h3>
          <p>
            Prior to taking office as the mayor of Overland Park in 2020, Ashlyn Guinn served as an active member of her community, whether she was taking action on her school board or working with nonprofits such as Head Start to better the early education of low-income children. Having served six years in the United States Navy, Ashlyn has devoted herself to bettering our nation as well as protecting her community, which is why she has worked with the city council to promote safety in Overland Park and support policies that will increase funding for our Police Departments and further sensitivity training so that our officers will be better prepared for any situation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ashlyn also believes that small businesses play a vital role in our community. Being a business owner herself, she knows firsthand how hard it is to lay the foundation for a new company, which is why she has worked one-on-one with business owners in the area as an advisor with the SDBC of Kansas. In her success as a business owner, Ashlyn can confidently say that she has dedicated the majority of her life to supporting the education of our youth and the growth of Overland Park’s small businesses. Her startup company, “TutorMeKC” not only caters to children with special needs but has evolved to accommodate language barriers and a wider age range of students so that learning can be possible for any student, any style. Being a mother to two boys, Ashlyn understands how important a strong education is to the parents of Overland Park, which is why she feels that struggling students deserve to have affordable tutors available in their area who understand their individual struggles and are able to adapt to their every need. In her spare time, Ashlyn works with special needs students in the Blue Valley School District and plans activities for the after-school services.
          </p>
          <p>
            Throughout the past four years, Ashlyn has made her top priorities as mayor clear by keeping her community heavily involved in change and working hand in hand with city council boards, frequently meeting with Kansas state legislators and discussing initiatives in her monthly town hall meetings. She focused heavily on creating more affordable housing, securing funding for our school districts, and improving resources for mental health, specifically for youth and veterans. While progress has been abundant during her time in office, whether it be implementing plans for a greener Overland Park, helping small businesses through her work in the SDBC, or supporting education reform, it is safe to say that if reelected, Ashlyn Guinn will continue to make progress in our community and work harder every day to build us a better tomorrow.
